# The IT-Crowd-table

Small exercise to see how much can be done in 4h.
The goal was to write a basic table with selection, a toolbar that can print some of the selected rows, all with CSS and some testing.
The exercise was meant to be done using TDD; I guess that is a failure as only a part of the API is tested in the end.
